# Building a Cyberpunk Portfolio

In a sea of minimalist, black-and-white developer portfolios, I wanted to build something that felt *alive*. A digital space that didn't just list my skills, but demonstrated them interactively. This is the story of how I built this cyberpunk-themed portfolio using the latest web technologies.

## 1. The Core Stack

At the heart of this project lies **Next.js 16**. The App Router architecture provides the backbone, allowing for efficient code-splitting using React Server Components.

```typescript
// app/layout.tsx
export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className="dark">
        <body className={cn(inter.className, "bg-black text-white antialiased")}>
            <Providers>{children}</Providers>
        </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

For styling, I embraced **Tailwind CSS v4**. The "dirty" utility classes are hidden behind a robust design system defined in `globals.css` with CSS variables for that signature Neon Cyan/Pink palette.

## 2. Immersive 3D with React Three Fiber

The star of the show is the **Floating AI Orb**. It's not a video; it's a real-time 3D object rendered in the browser.

I used `@react-three/fiber`, which reconciles Three.js elements into the React virtual DOM. This allows the Orb to react to state changes (like hovering or speaking) just like a `<div>` would.

```tsx
<Canvas>
    <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
    <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
    <Sphere args={[1, 32, 32]}>
        <meshStandardMaterial
            color="#00f3ff"
            wireframe={true}
            emissive="#00f3ff"
            emissiveIntensity={2}
        />
    </Sphere>
</Canvas>
```

## 3. DevOps: Deployment Behind a VPN

Deploying a modern app is usually easy with Vercel. But I wanted to host this on my own VPS to control the data and costs. The challenge? My server is behind a VPN and doesn't have a public SSH ip open to the world.

### The "Watchtower" Pattern

Instead of pushing code to the server, the server pulls it.

1.  **CI (GitHub Actions)**: On every release, we build a Docker image and push it to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).
2.  **Server**: A container named **Watchtower** runs alongside my app. It checks for new images every 5 minutes.
3.  **Auto-Update**: When a new image is found, Watchtower gracefully restarts the portfolio container with the new version.

```yaml
# docker-compose.prod.yml
services:
  portfolio:
    image: ghcr.io/avidflyer17/myportfolio:latest
    restart: always
  
  watchtower:
    image: containrrr/watchtower
    command: --interval 300
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

## Conclusion

This portfolio is a playground. It proves that we can build interfaces that are both performant (Lighthouse score 95+) and visually rich.

The complete source code is private for now, but I might open-source components of the design system in the future. Stay tuned!
